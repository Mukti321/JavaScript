<variable>
===========
-> Variables are containers for storing information.
-> Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable:
-> A variable declared without a value have the value undefined.

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

1) Automatically
2) Using var
3) Using let
4) Using const


<There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).>
===========================================================================
a) Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).

b) Variable names cannot contain spaces.

c) Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if,var or const.

d) By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.

e)Variables should be given descriptive names that indicate their content and usage (e.g. sellingPrice and costPrice rather than x and y).
